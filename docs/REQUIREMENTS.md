# One Job - Requirements Specification

> **Document Version**: 1.0  
> **Last Updated**: January 2025  
> **Status**: MVP Complete, Integration Phase Planning

## 🎯 Project Overview

One Job is a mobile-first task management application built with domain-driven design principles. It implements a card-based interface where users see one task at a time, enabling focused work through swipe-based interactions and hierarchical task organization.

### Vision Statement
*"Focus on one job at a time with beautiful, swipe-to-interact mobile-first interface."*

### Key Design Philosophy
- **Single-task focus**: Display only the current task to maintain concentration
- **Mobile-first**: Touch-optimized responsive design with gesture controls
- **Domain-driven**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **API-first**: All functionality exposed via RESTful API
