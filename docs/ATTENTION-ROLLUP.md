# One Job — what needs xian · v77 (2026-10-07)

**Cite as "Coral rollup v77".** One file, one URL:

Older items, settled decisions and history:
[`docs/archive/ATTENTION-ROLLUP-ARCHIVE.md`](archive/ATTENTION-ROLLUP-ARCHIVE.md).
The narrative is in `development/coral-logs/`.

## Where things stand

Nothing is blocked on you right now. You filled in TestFlight's Test
Information (10-07), and build 40 went to Apple's beta review the same
evening. It's the first One Job build ever submitted for outside
testers. When Apple approves it, I'll tell you, and you re-send Pilot tester A
the Pilot link. That will be her first real chance to join. The fix for
Siri cards not appearing while the app is open is half done and goes
in build 41. The UX session is still unscheduled, and the prep is ready.

## Open

### 🟡 22. UX session: screen by screen, you narrate
You want it live and conversational. Prep (walk order plus eight
design questions) is in
https://github.com/Design-in-Product/one-job/blob/main/docs/UX-SESSION-PREP-2026-09.md
**Where to act:** name a time to Janus or in Coral's session. Bring
your usability screenshots.
**Since:** 2026-08-13
**Ask:** Name a time for the UX session.
**Rec:** Do it before any roadmap talk. Your narration is the evidence
that conversation should use.

### 🟡 27. How does answering from the attention deck feel?
You get these items as cards in One Job (download
https://onejob.co/probe/latest.json, then Settings → bring in as a new
deck). Whether a card is a good place to answer an agent is the
question behind the deck.
**Where to act:** one word, in Coral's session or to Janus.
**Since:** 2026-08-31
**Ask:** How did answering from the deck actually feel?
**Rec:** Relief, ceremony, or in between. One word is enough.

### 🟢 10. Retire REQUIREMENTS.md, or rewrite it?
It's a 434-line spec from July that's no longer true. ROADMAP.md and
VISION.md now say what's true, and Themis found nobody reads it.
File: https://github.com/Design-in-Product/one-job/blob/main/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
**Where to act:** one word, in Coral's session or to Janus.
**Since:** 2026-07-28
**Ask:** REQUIREMENTS.md: retire it or rewrite it?
**Rec:** Retire it. I'd add a "superseded, see ROADMAP/VISION" note at
the top and keep the file, so it's easy to undo.

**Verified how (v77):**

    weekly-question line; feedback email and privacy URL set.
  - Review contact: all four fields set (values not recorded here).
  - Build 40 review submission: 201, and externalBuildState is
    WAITING_FOR_BETA_REVIEW.

    approves the build and Pilot tester A re-joins.
