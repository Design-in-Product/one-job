## Session Activities

### 9:30 AM - Session Initialization & Status Check
- ✅ **Checked git status**: Clean on main branch
- ✅ **Reviewed session logs**: Previous session documented TailwindCSS issue unresolved
- ✅ **Identified problem**: Assets deployed correctly but design not visible

### 9:35 AM - Root Cause Discovery & Fix
- 🔍 **Systematic verification applied**: Checked tailwind.config.ts 
- 🎯 **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: TailwindCSS gradients hardcoded to old purple colors
  - `taskGradient-start`: #4F46E5 (old purple) → #F4533C (coral)
  - `taskGradient-end`: #7C3AED (old purple) → #E73C7E (coral gradient)
  - `deferredGradient`: Updated to coral variants
- ⚡ **React components use**: `from-taskGradient-start to-taskGradient-end` (TailwindCSS classes)
- ❌ **NOT using**: Custom CSS classes `.task-card`, `.btn-primary` that I created
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated tailwind.config.ts with coral colors
- ✅ **Built & deployed**: New assets with coral gradients pushed to GitHub Pages

### Key Insight
The custom CSS design system I created was technically correct but UNUSED by React components. The actual styling comes from TailwindCSS utility classes that reference the config file. This demonstrates the importance of checking HOW components actually get their styles, not just WHETHER the CSS exists.
