### Session Activities
[11:25 AM] - New session started
[11:26 AM] - Created today's session log
[11:27 AM] - User has new design ideas from testing experience - not bugs but updated design vision
[11:30 AM] - **MAJOR DESIGN PIVOT**: User provided comprehensive "Card Deck Experience" spec
[11:31 AM] - Spec analysis: Complete redesign from current interface to card deck metaphor
[11:35 AM] - Q&A session: Clarifying implementation details
[11:37 AM] - Key decisions: Replace tabs entirely, refactor existing components, gentle arc menu above deck
[11:40 AM] - Backend integration decision: Keep CRUD API (Option A) with optimistic UI updates
[11:40 AM] - Ready to begin Card Deck Experience implementation
[12:00 PM] - **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**: Phase 1 of Card Deck Experience
[12:05 PM] - Components created: CardDeck.tsx, LongPressMenu.tsx, updated TaskCard.tsx
[12:07 PM] - Added 4 flip animation variations with CSS keyframes
[12:10 PM] - Refactored Index.tsx to remove tabs and use CardDeck as primary interface
[8:00 PM] - Fixed port conflicts and server issues
[8:05 PM] - Dev server now running on http://localhost:8082 with forced cache clearing
[8:06 PM] - Ready for user testing of Card Deck Experience
[8:10 PM] - **BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**: User still cannot access development server on any port
[8:15 PM] - Prepared for session handoff due to undiagnosed server connectivity issue
[8:20 PM] - Created comprehensive handoff document: HANDOFF_CARD_DECK_IMPLEMENTATION.md
[8:25 PM] - Committed all Card Deck Experience implementation (commit a5a7eef)

### Session End Summary
- **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Complete Card Deck Experience Phase 1 implementation
- **Status**: Ready for testing but blocked by server accessibility issues
- **Handoff Prepared**: HANDOFF_CARD_DECK_IMPLEMENTATION.md contains full context
- **Code Status**: All changes committed successfully
- **Critical Blocker**: Development server not accessible in browser despite successful startup

### Implementation Completed
- ✅ CardDeck component with face-down/face-up states
- ✅ LongPressMenu with gentle arc layout
- ✅ Enhanced TaskCard with flip interactions
- ✅ Removed tabbed interface entirely
- ✅ 4 random flip animation variations
- ✅ Auto-flip timeout behavior (1 minute)
- ✅ Maintained full API integration
- ✅ Mobile-optimized touch interactions

### Next Session Priority
**#1 CRITICAL**: Diagnose and fix development server accessibility
- Code compiles successfully but browser cannot connect
- Tried multiple ports (8080, 3000, 8081, 8082) - all fail with connection refused
- User needs to see and test Card Deck Experience implementation

### Lessons Learned
- **Design Pivot Success**: Successfully transformed entire interface paradigm
- **Systematic Implementation**: Followed CLAUDE.md verification methodology
- **Architecture Solid**: Component structure supports card deck metaphor well
- **Testing Blocked**: Must resolve server issues before user validation

### Notes & Insights
- User has been actively testing the current interface
- Focus is on design improvements rather than functional fixes
- User wants to present ideas in list form for collaborative discussion
- Approach: Listen to all ideas first, then synthesize into coherent design direction

### Methodology Reminder
- **Systematic Verification First**: Review existing design patterns before implementing
- **Mobile-First Testing**: All design changes must work on actual devices
- **Document Design Decisions**: Update design system documentation with changes
- **Excellence Flywheel**: Build on existing coral design system foundation
