# Handoff Note for Next Claude Session

## üìç CURRENT STATUS - READY FOR MOBILE TESTING

**Project**: One Job - Mobile-first task management app  
**Phase**: Development environment verified, ready for mobile device testing  
**Date**: July 31, 2025

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

**Priority 1: Mobile Device Testing** 
- Both services are running and stable
- Need to test swipe gestures on actual mobile device
- Critical for mobile-first application validation

## üîß TECHNICAL STATE

### Services Running
- **Backend**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite)
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:8081` (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- **API Status**: Working, returns 2 existing completed tasks
- **Build Status**: Production builds working (`npm run build`)

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Backend (from /Users/xian/Development/one-job/backend)
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (from /Users/xian/Development/one-job)
npm run dev  # Runs on port 8081

# Verify both working
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks  # Should return JSON with 2 tasks
```

### Architecture Verified
- ‚úÖ **Contract Fidelity**: 100% alignment between frontend-backend APIs
- ‚úÖ **Deferral Bug**: Fixed in previous session (confirmed working)
- ‚úÖ **Database**: SQLite with test data at `backend/onejob.db`
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-First Design**: Ready for device testing

## üìã TODO LIST STATUS

**Completed This Session:**
- ‚úÖ Test current build on laptop web browser
- ‚úÖ Resolve port conflicts and environment setup
- ‚úÖ Verify API integration working

**Next Up (High Priority):**
- üîÑ **Test on mobile device browser** (CRITICAL - main mobile UX validation)
- üîÑ Develop beta testing strategy
- üîÑ Develop backend integration strategy

## üîç KEY CONTEXT FOR SUCCESS

### 1. Systematic Verification First Methodology
- **Always grep for existing patterns before implementing**
- **Verify frontend-backend contracts before making changes**
- Document in CLAUDE.md has full methodology

### 2. Mobile Testing is Critical
- One Job is mobile-first with swipe gestures
- Swipe right = complete task, swipe left = defer task
- Must test on actual mobile device browser, not just responsive mode
- Look for: touch responsiveness, gesture smoothness, card interactions

### 3. Known Working Patterns
```bash
# Find API integration patterns
grep -r "fetch.*8000" src/ --include="*.tsx" -A 3 -B 3

# Find task action handlers  
grep -r "handleComplete\|handleDefer\|handleAdd" src/ --include="*.tsx" -A 5 -B 5

# Test API endpoints
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs  # FastAPI documentation
```

## üìÅ KEY FILES TO UNDERSTAND

### Critical Files
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Complete methodology and project guidance (MUST READ)
- **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**: Main application with API integration
- **`backend/main.py`**: FastAPI backend with all endpoints
- **`SESSION_LOG_2025-07-31.md`**: Today's work retrospective

### Quick Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React components with swipe gestures (Framer Motion)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Pydantic models, SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL ready for production
- **API Contract**: Tasks have `status: 'todo'|'done'`, deferral uses `is_deferral: true`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Port Management
- Services auto-select ports if conflicts exist
- Frontend typically runs on 8081, backend on 8000
- If port conflicts, kill processes: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9`

### Contract Alignment
- Previous session achieved 100% frontend-backend contract fidelity
- DO NOT change API contracts without systematic verification
- Use existing patterns rather than creating new ones

### Mobile Testing Requirements
- Test actual swipe gestures on touch device
- Verify task completion/deferral actions work
- Check card stacking and navigation
- Validate responsive design across screen sizes

## üöÄ SUCCESS METRICS FOR NEXT SESSION

**Mobile Testing Success:**
- [ ] Swipe right completes tasks on mobile device
- [ ] Swipe left defers tasks to bottom of stack
- [ ] Touch interactions feel responsive and smooth
- [ ] Navigation between tasks/substacks works on mobile
- [ ] Cards display correctly on various screen sizes

**Ready for Beta Testing:**
- [ ] Mobile UX validated and smooth
- [ ] Any mobile-specific issues identified and documented
- [ ] Beta testing strategy developed based on mobile findings

## üéØ WHAT I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO KNOW

1. **Services are already running and stable** - don't spend time debugging setup
2. **Contract verification is complete** - focus on user experience testing
3. **Mobile testing is the critical gap** - laptop testing is done, mobile is next
4. **CLAUDE.md has the full methodology** - read it first for context
5. **TodoWrite tool usage is established** - continue using for task tracking
6. **Database has test data** - 2 completed tasks ready for testing

---

**Bottom Line**: Environment is solid, contracts verified, ready for mobile device testing. Focus on validating the mobile-first UX that makes One Job special.
