## Screenshot Analysis: 2025-08-05-06_50_55.png

### My Independent Review:

**Visual/Layout Issues:**
1. **Typography hierarchy**: "One Job" title could be larger/more prominent
2. **Button contrast**: "Try Live Demo" button vs "View Code" - demo button should be more prominent
3. **Section spacing**: Some sections feel cramped, especially "Why One Job?" icons
4. **Mobile responsiveness**: Hard to assess from desktop view, but sections might be too dense for mobile
5. **Color consistency**: Mix of purple, orange, green colors - could be more cohesive with coral theme
6. **Footer alignment**: "Made with ❤️" footer text seems misaligned or awkward

**Content/UX Issues:**
1. **CTA clarity**: Two buttons at top might confuse users about primary action
2. **Feature icons**: Some icons in "Why One Job?" section are small/hard to see
3. **FAQ section**: Questions might be too detailed for landing page
4. **Project Status**: "MVP Complete" vs "Coming Soon" creates confusion about what's available

**Technical Issues:**
1. **Favicon**: Already noted - still Lovable logo
2. **Image quality**: Some icons appear pixelated or low-res
3. **Loading**: Can't assess from screenshot, but page might be heavy

Waiting for your independent review before we compare notes and finalize the list.
